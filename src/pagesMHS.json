By intentionally curating this community, we hope to form bonds between Black students that are, at times, hard to create given how we have been dispersed in the diaspora.  Consequently, the Black Student Union is critical to maintain, sustain, buttress and bolster African American students. We affirm our commitment to highlighting and uplifting the varied realities of the African American experiences within our community.  We recognize and affirm that everyone has a unique perspective and lens through which they engage the world.

Below is a description of each line of service. \nDisaster Services\nDisaster relief focuses not only on the most urgent disaster response efforts but prevention and preparedness as well. On any given day, when a disaster strikes, Disaster Action Teams and local caseworkers are deployed on-site, stationed at shelters, and on standby at local Red Cross chapters to help those affected receive the food, care, and basic resources they need to recover.\nService to the Armed Forces\nThis branch of the American Red Cross focuses on active service members, veterans, and their families. Emergency communications services play a central role—uniting families with the armed forces, connecting military hospitals and wounded warrior units, providing assistance in health care facilities, and more.\nTraining Services\nTraining and preparedness education are key facets to the Training Services branch. These training hope to enable those certified to prevent, prepare for, and respond in a number of life-threatening scenarios\nBlood Services (Biomedical Services)\nOne of the most well-known of the five lines of services, the American Red Cross Blood Services branch provides a life-saving supply of blood. \nInternational Services\nThe Red Cross strengthens leadership, financial management, volunteer networks, and supports the global movement.
