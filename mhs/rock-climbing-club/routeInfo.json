Climbing is primarily an individual sport: you're goal is to improve your own technique, strength, and mind. But, when you climb with others, it becomes a really great communal sport. We aim to be a supportive club for both beginners and those wanting to get really good at climbing. At the base of it, all we want to do is have fun and climb stuff.
