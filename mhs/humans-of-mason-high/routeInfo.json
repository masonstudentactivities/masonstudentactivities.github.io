Inspired by Humans of New York—a digital photoblog that shares the stories of everyday citizens—our club has a conversation with an MHS student or staff member each week and features them through a social media post. These posts include a picture of the individual and a caption about any aspect of their background (passions, perspectives, or experiences) as told by them. Through this page, we hope to enable our community to learn about the diverse lives behind all the unfamiliar faces in the hallways, ultimately encouraging connection and empathy at our large high school.","mobilityRating":"Low","soundRating":"Medium","advisorName":"Renee Zegar","advisorEmail":"zegarr@masonohioschools.com","additionalName":"shriyapsarathi@gmail.com","additionalEmail":"shriya.parthasarathi38@masonohioschools.com","additionalTitle":"Club Leader","thumbURL":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P8EHccGd-QAc8OZBULywwKqBZsttURXs","additionalContent":"No","sectionOneTitle":"","sectionOneContent":"","sectionTwoTitle":"","sectionTwoContent":"","sectionThreeTitle":"","sectionThreeContent":"","fileExtension":"jpeg"}},"path":"mhs/humans-of-mason-high"}
