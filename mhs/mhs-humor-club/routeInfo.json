Humor Club is a place where stress and anxiety no longer exist. Itâ€™s a friendly place where members can perform stand up comedy, create memes, and just simply tell jokes to let their stress out. We meet 1-2 times a month on Fridays to relieve stress and come together as MHS. We also have many volunteering outreach events all throughout the year.","mobilityRating":"Low","soundRating":"High","advisorName":"Bud Strudthoff","advisorEmail":"strudthoffb@masonohioschools.com","additionalName":"Saketh Kalikiri","additionalEmail":"saketh.kalikiri62@masonohioschools.com","additionalTitle":"Club Leader","thumbURL":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bxxggrp9RXKOPZhTGlluMgB-M8KWbJdz","additionalContent":"No","sectionOneTitle":"","sectionOneContent":"","sectionTwoTitle":"","sectionTwoContent":"","sectionThreeTitle":"","sectionThreeContent":"","fileExtension":"png"}},"path":"mhs/mhs-humor-club"}
