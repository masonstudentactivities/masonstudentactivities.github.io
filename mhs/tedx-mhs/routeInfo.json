Speakers and Organizers will be involved in the development of a main event held at the end of the school year. Student speakers will have the chance to share their perspective and engage with the community; while organizers dedicate their time to finding speakers and coordinating events. Throughout the year, various topics and interests of members will be integrated, to form a cohesive theme for each yearâ€™s final event. Members play a crucial role in the progress and direction of this club; leadership opportunities will be available.
