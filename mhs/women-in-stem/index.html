We connect members with internships and summer programs, host guest speakers, and hold events that raise awareness of the gender inequalities within STEM fields. We also have opportunities for students to explore their unique interests and learn more about different fields of STEM.</p><h4>What does a typical meeting look like?</h4><p>We will feature a different STEM career each meeting. Hopefully, these small snippets of STEM careers will help you find possible careers! We will also try to feature different college/summer STEM programs so members can get insight into possible opportunities they want to pursue. This club will also be an advocate for gender equality in the STEM industry. We will work as a club to speak out for change. Some meetings we will have a guest speaker to help members learn more about a certain career! We are open to all new ideas! We look forward to hearing member&#x27;s ideas for the club!
