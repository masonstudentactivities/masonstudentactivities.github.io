This club meets from 2:45-4:30 PM on Fridays throughout the school year. All instruments are welcome, but all members should be somewhat skilled on their instrument and have a basic knowledge of music theory. Membership is limited for this club, so auditions for new members are held at the beginning of the school year.","mobilityRating":"Medium","soundRating":"High","advisorName":"TJ Wilson","advisorEmail":"wilsonth@masonohioschools.com","additionalName":"Brodie Hansen","additionalEmail":"brodie.hansen78@masonohioschools.com","additionalTitle":"Club Leader","thumbURL":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cOSDrF-WBlZA-oUN8a3bqHKMkqjy9dDP","additionalContent":"No","sectionOneTitle":"","sectionOneContent":"","sectionTwoTitle":"","sectionTwoContent":"","sectionThreeTitle":"","sectionThreeContent":"","fileExtension":"png"}},"path":"mhs/live-music-club"}
