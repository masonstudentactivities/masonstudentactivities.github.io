We will be meeting every two weeks from 2:30 to 3:30. In these meetings we will be learning about flight fundamentals, using flight simulators to learn how to fly, completing fun experiments and competing in engaging engineering challenges against one another for prizes. There will be lots of opportunities to build and fly model airplanes and rockets. We will also have speakers who have been/are in the aerospace field come in and share their experiences with the group. If you have any questions, please reach out.","mobilityRating":"Medium","soundRating":"Medium","advisorName":"Amy Forsythe","advisorEmail":"forsythea@masonohioschools.com","additionalName":"N/A","additionalEmail":"N/A","additionalTitle":"","thumbURL":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PC0vmdj-I0ilxyMjvbeAub35eh358ZKm","additionalContent":"No","sectionOneTitle":"","sectionOneContent":"","sectionTwoTitle":"","sectionTwoContent":"","sectionThreeTitle":"","sectionThreeContent":"","fileExtension":"png"}},"path":"mhs/mhs-aerospace-flight-club"}
