At its heart, there is no competition but one's own previous efforts. But, not many people rock climb alone. It is a very communal sport, and we hope to capture this in MHS Rock Climbing Club. You don't have to be a great climber to have fun, you just need to be willing to try climbing out. So that means beginners are very much welcome! As for what we do, we do all types of climbing: bouldering, top-rope, auto-belay, and lead climbing.","mobilityRating":"High","soundRating":"High","advisorName":"TJ Wilson","advisorEmail":"wilsonth@masonohioschools.com","additionalName":"Mark Wyatt","additionalEmail":"wyattm@masonohioschools.com","additionalTitle":"Club Leader","thumbURL":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1geJHrOpJzp_mpxGQtvJmXNbGqdVwHOlF","additionalContent":"Yes","sectionOneTitle":"Where?","sectionOneContent":"We climb at rock climbing gym called Mosaic, which is on Union Cemetery Road.","sectionTwoTitle":"What do you need to climb?","sectionTwoContent":"First, wear athletic clothes that you can move around in.
