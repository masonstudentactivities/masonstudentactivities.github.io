We are all passionate about pursuing a career in engineering and conduct many projects to help get there. We have meetings every 2nd Wednesday in Room B112 and our meetings consist of learning about different aspects of engineering. We’ll have projects, building challenges, guest speakers, volunteer opportunities and ways to get recognition for the work you’ve put for the club and community. We’re also planning on working with several national level competitions that you can compete in. We do not have any club fees and we want to make the club accessible to all. Any ideas you might have can be sent to us to make it possible!
