We build youth leadership skills and team cooperation skills. Our club is a year-round activity, from September to May for younger teammates, through July for older more competitive teammates. We host tryouts in May. We offer After School Enrichment Programs at MECC, ME and MI. Many students start there. If they really enjoy jumping rope, they try out for the team.","mobilityRating":"High","soundRating":"High","advisorName":"Vikki Robinson","advisorEmail":"vikkirobinson@cinci.rr.com","additionalName":"Nicole Rogers","additionalEmail":"nicole@cometskippers.org","additionalTitle":"Team Manager","thumbURL":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1B0iG1WSUuvCj2Ls9EKbO3C3zVRK8Y42T","additionalContent":"No","sectionOneTitle":"","sectionOneContent":"","sectionTwoTitle":"","sectionTwoContent":"","sectionThreeTitle":"","sectionThreeContent":"","fileExtension":"png"}},"path":"mhs/comet-skippers"}
