You will learn the differences between different types of filament, such as impact strength, or flexibility. From learning what programs to use, to the science of how a 3D printer works, the MHS 3D Printing Club is the place to go for anything 3D-Printer related. Throughout the year, we hope to have various 3D Printing sales, where you will have the opportunity to sell your own 3D objects.
