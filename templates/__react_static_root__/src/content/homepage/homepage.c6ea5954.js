These conferences typically take place over multiple days, with multiple sessions devoted to tackling different topics under the larger structure of a single United Nations Committee or similar organizational body. After hours of fruitful debate and discussion, delegates vote on a comprehensive solution tailored to the topic that everyone participating agrees on, promoting amity, cooperation, and understanding between students.","sectionTwoTitle":"WilmaMUN","sectionTwoContent":"Every year, Model UN hosts a conference of their own!

Club members take time to create committees on their own to run them for delegates from local high schools. Topics and content vary widely, emphasizing creativity and originality with past committees including: The Eagle And Dragon: War In The South China Sea, Operation Nowhere and Entree: Murder Mystery, and 2100, Turn of the Century: The Race to Relocate and Reallocate in Global Climate Catastrophe. Every member will have the opportunity to present an idea to be voted upon and selected by the club, so we’re looking forward to seeing your submissions this fall!
