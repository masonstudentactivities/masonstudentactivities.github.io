By intentionally curating this community, we hope to form bonds between Black students that are, at times, hard to create given how we have been dispersed in the diaspora.  Consequently, the Black Student Union is critical to maintain, sustain, buttress and bolster African American students. We affirm our commitment to highlighting and uplifting the varied realities of the African American experiences within our community.  We recognize and affirm that everyone has a unique perspective and lens through which they engage the world.
