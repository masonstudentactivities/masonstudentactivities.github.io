Consequently, the Black Student Union is critical to maintain, sustain, buttress and bolster African American students.

Our coach always compares it to a “track team for SCIENCE”; each individual event contributes to our overall team score. Teams of 15 students represent Mason, and groups of 2 or 3 students compete in each event. The 23 events are build-based, laboratory-based, or study and research-based, and the STEM focus of each event surrounds biology, life sciences, chemistry, physics, earth and space sciences, engineering, and/or technology. Most competitors will choose to compete in 2 to 5 events that spark their interest in any given season.","sectionTwoTitle":"","sectionTwoContent":"Mason typically sends 2 or 3 teams to each competition, so up to 45 students represent our school every time. Since teams switch frequently throughout the season, students work with many different partners across the school year. Competition trips are usually overnight on Saturdays, at a high school or university either in-state or out-of-state, and Mason competes at ~10 competitions per season starting in December. Attending competitions eventually prepares us for the Regional, State, and National Tournament in May (which we won for the first time in 2021!).  Additionally, Mason Science Olympiad runs an Invitational of our own each spring where we host teams from different schools. This is an opportunity to better our understanding of each event, meet fellow Science Olympians across the nation, and give back to the Science Olympiad community.","sectionThreeTitle":"","sectionThreeContent":"Aside from the first couple months of the school year where we learn and brainstorm for each event together, this club has no recurring meetings; the time commitment is entirely self-decided.

Ultimately, Science Olympiad is a program that promotes strong team bonds, leadership, and above all else, fosters a passion for STEM.","fileExtension":"png"},{"timestamp":"2022-03-13T00:03:19.989Z","editorEmail":"schlaegerj@masonohioschools.com","name":"SIBS","category":"Involvement","schoologyPage":"","website":"","description":"SIBS is a group of carefully selected upperclassmen who provide mentoring to the freshmen class, and awareness of social isolation and inclusion.
