Club members select from a wide variety of art and craft type projects they are interested in and they vote on the projects they find the most interesting to work on for the semester. Students can choose to work on the featured project, or bring their own, digital devices (tablets) to create with. Students are encouraged to share their work and explore new media while making new friends and contributing to a community of young artists within our school. Projects may include drawing, painting, digital art, sculpture, polymer clay, paper quilling, tie dye, printmaking, macrame, collage, watercolor, scratch art, crochet, calligraphy/decorative lettering, glass fused jewelry, basket making, metal reposse', paper lanters, origami and more! We generally make about 6 projects per semester. The $10 fee is for materials. Because of room capacity, the club is limited to no more than 40 students per semester.
